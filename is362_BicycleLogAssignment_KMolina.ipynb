    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Suppose you have ridden a bicycle from New York City to Key West, Florida. Each day, you've logged the total cumulative miles on your odometer at the end of the day. For example, your first two entries might be 55 and 120, indicating that you rode 55 miles on day 1 and 65 miles on day 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to create a **Pandas Series** object that holds the cumulative miles at the end of each day, and then compute the actual number of miles ridden each day by calculating the difference between consecutive entries.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I used Python and the Pandas library to effectively calculate the total miles ridden each day during a bicycle trip from New York City to Key West, based on cumulative odometer readings. By leveraging the `.diff()` function, I computed the differences between consecutive days' cumulative miles to determine the exact distance traveled on each day. The results were presented in a clear and structured DataFrame for easy interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise helped reinforce important concepts such as working with Pandas Series and DataFrames, calculating differences between values, and displaying the data in a meaningful way. Additionally, the use of a Jupyter notebook allowed for an organized presentation of the problem and the solution, making it easy to follow the workflow from raw data to final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, I successfully solved the problem by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating a Pandas Series for cumulative miles.\n",
    "- Computing daily miles using the `.diff()` function.\n",
    "- Presenting both cumulative and daily miles in a DataFrame format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be applied to similar data analysis problems where calculating differences between consecutive values is needed, further demonstrating the power and flexibility of Python's data manipulation libraries."
